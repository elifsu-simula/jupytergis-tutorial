# Introduction

[JupyterGIS](https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis) is a JupyterLab extension that allows you to work
collaboratively on GIS projects. It has basic support for QGIS project
files, so you can import and export projects between QGIS and
JupyterGIS, and the layer styles, data sources and project settings will
be preserved.

You can work together with other members of your team on projects in
real time, using collaborative features of JupyterGIS such as real-time
editing, cursor tracking, follow mode, and annotations.

JupyterGIS also provides a Python API that can be used to add data
sources and layers, edit symbology, add filters, and work together with
other geospatial libraries, such as GeoPandas, Xarray and Rasterio, to
perform data analysis.

```{admonition} What you will learn
