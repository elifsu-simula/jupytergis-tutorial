# More on Symbology and Processing

Let's explore other options in symbology and processing using the bike
stations layer.

:::{admonition} Hands on
:class: tip
- Right click on the Countries layer, under processing, try convex hull, centroids, bounding boxes and
  concave hull.
- Right click on the bike stations layer on the layers panel, then click
  on Edit Symbology.
- Experiment with different render types both in Color and in Radius
  tabs.
- Set the radius based on bike stands, and color based on available bike
  stands.
- Under processing, try adding radius.
- Add the dissolve process with the dissolve field set to contract name,
  then try identifying different data points in the newly created layer.
