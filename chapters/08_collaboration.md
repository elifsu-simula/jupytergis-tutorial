# Real Time Collaboration

One of the most important features of JupyterGIS is the ability to
collaborate on the same project in real time. In this part we will
explore these collaborative features.

When you create a JGIS project, notice that you are given an anonymous
username and icon, which appears in the upper right corner.

```{figure} ../images/anon_username.png
:name: fig-anon-username
:width: 100%
Anonymous username
```


## Share project with others

In order to invite users to collaborate on your project, you can copy
the link by clicking the share button in the upper right corner. When
new collaborators join, their icon will appear in the right side of the
toolbar. You can also watch their cursors' movements in real time, which
is useful for pointing to a specific location, or knowing where they are
working on.

## Real-time editing

The changes made on the project is instantly shared with all
collaborators, such as adding a new layer, or changing symbology. This
allows users to work together on the project.

This is also true for notebooks. When a user writes or executes code in
a notebook, other users can read, edit and run the written code in real
time.

## Follow mode

Follow mode allows you to track another user's activity in the document
in real time. When enabled, you'll see their actions as they navigate
and edit. This feature is ideal for live demonstrations, interactive
sessions, and collaborative meetings, as it lets you quickly align your
view with a teammate's actions and provide immediate feedback.

To activate the follow mode, you can click on a collaborator's user icon
in the upper right corner. Then the document will have a frame in their
assigned color. You can click on the user icon again to exit follow
mode.

## Adding Annotations and Comments

Annotations and comments let you add notes directly on your GIS file,
which makes it easier for your team to track important details, provide
context, ask questions, or share insights.

In order to create annotations, you can right-click anywhere on your GIS
file to open the context menu, then select Add Annotation from the menu.
All collaborators can see the new annotation in real time.

Once you add an annotation, you can click on it to type your comment.
You can open the right sidebar to view all annotations and comments in
the document, and click on the middle button to locate the annotation.

Now let's try these collaborative features! Connect to the project with
the provided link and do the following:

:::{admonition} Hands on
:class: tip
- Find out your username.
- Add a new layer or change a layer's symbology. Observe the changes
  other people make.
- Follow a user by activating follow mode. Then deactivate it.
- Observe other cursors on the project. Try clicking on a cursor.
- Create an annotation and add a comment.
- Add a comment to an annotation created by someone else.
