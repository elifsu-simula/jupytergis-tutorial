# Conclusion

Congratulations! You have finished the JupyterGIS tutorial. Now you have
the necessary skills to:

- Create and manage GIS projects directly in JupyterLab.

- Add raster and vector layers, edit their symbology, and apply
  processing tools.

- Explore and import data through the STAC browser.

- Save and reopen projects with preserved layer styles and settings.

- Use the Python API to add data, filter layers, and integrate with
  other geospatial libraries.

- Perform geospatial analyses, such as computing NDVI from satellite
  data, then export results to GeoTIFFs for further use in GIS
  applications.

- Collaborate in real time with teammates, using features like follow
  mode, annotations, and live editing.

With these skills, you can start building your own collaborative GIS
workflows, explore more datasets, and extend JupyterGIS with Python for
advanced analysis.
