# Project: Find Optimal EV Charging Station Placement in ÃŽle-de-France

In this part of the tutorial, you are going to apply all you have learned on this project. You need to find a pair and work together with your pair, not from the same computer, but using the collaborative feature of JupyterGIS.

  Find a pair!

Your task is to analyze existing EV charging station distribution and related infrastructure, and propose 3 new candidate locations for EV chargers.

:class: tip
- Import the charging stations dataset from https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/assets/osm-france-charging-station/, note that it can take a bit of time to load this dataset as it is a big dataset.
- Import the road network dataset from https://data.iledefrance.fr/explore/dataset/rrir_national_iledefrance_wgs84/information/
- Import the cafe/restaurant dataset from https://data.iledefrance.fr/explore/dataset/ensemble-des-lieux-de-restauration-des-crous/information/
- Look for other datasets that can be useful, such as population or power grid.
- Identify three locations for new chargers, make use of tools in JupyterGIS such as symbology, buffer, filtering, follow mode etc.
- Mark the locations via annotations and explain why that spot is you choice as a comment.
